    "A **Pesquisa Nacional por Amostra de Domicílios - PNAD** investiga anualmente, de forma permanente, características gerais da população, de educação, trabalho, rendimento e habitação e outras, com periodicidade variável, de acordo com as necessidades de informação para o país, como as características sobre migração, fecundidade, nupcialidade, saúde, segurança alimentar, entre outros temas. O levantamento dessas estatísticas constitui, ao longo dos 49 anos de realização da pesquisa, um importante instrumento para formulação, validação e avaliação de políticas orientadas para o desenvolvimento socioeconômico e a melhoria das condições de vida no Brasil."

Nosso supervisor determinou que o **erro máximo em relação a média seja de R$\\$$ 10,00**. Sabemos que o **desvio padrão populacional** deste grupo de trabalhadores é de **R$\\$$ 1.082,79** e que a **média populacional** é de **R$\\$$ 1.426,54**. Para um **nível de confiança de 95%**, qual deve ser o tamanho da amostra de nosso estudo? Qual o intervalo de confiança para a média considerando o tamanho de amostra obtido?"
